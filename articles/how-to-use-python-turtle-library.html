                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>For Pi Day, I hosted a workshop on my Twitch channel during the Twitch Women’s Guild Pi Day Raid Train. This article goes over a quick tutorial 
                    on how to use the Python Turtle library, as well as additional resources if you want to explore more. Additionally, if you’re an educator who 
                    wants to use this workshop for a course, there’s a link to the workshop document at the bottom that you can share with your students. The document 
                    contains everything on this website, but you’ll be able to download it as a PDF so you can post it for your students, without them needing to visit this website.
                </p>
                <p>Python’s Turtle Library allows us to use a variety of methods to create art using code! In this workshop, we will be learning how to create our own drawing 
                    of a Turtle, as well as learning a few other tools and tips to create unique patterns. The code used for this workshop can be found on my GitHub
                    (linked at the end).</p>
                <h3>What You'll Need</h3>
                <p>If you want to do this locally on your device (installation required):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Install Python (latest version) <a href="https://python.org/downloads">here</a>.</li>
                    <li>Install an IDE of your choice (I personally use Visual Studio Code which can be found <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">here</a>).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you want to do this on the cloud (no installation required):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create an account on <a href="https://replit.com">Replit</a>.</li>
                    <li>Create a new "Repl" using the "Python (with Turtle)" template.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Method Dictionary</h3>
                <p> We'll be using a variety of methods throughout this example. Here's the definitions and information about their parameters.</p>

                </div>
                <h3>Drawing a Turtle</h3>
                <p>We will start by creating a turtle. This turtle looks like this:</p>
                <div class="pyturtimg">
                    <img src="../images/articleimgs/pythonturtle.png">
                </div>
                <p>You’ll get the opportunity to customize the colors of your turtle! This exercise will allow you to test how creating shapes work, 
                    but the exact code for my turtle will be shown at the end. Good luck!</p>
                <h4>Steps:</h4>
                <p>Create a new file or Repl. On Repl, title it "Turtle Drawing". Locally, title it "TurtleDrawing.py".</p>
                <p>At the top of your file, include the following line:</p>
                <table class="codetable">
                    <th>import turtle</th>
                </table>
                <p> This line will allow us to use the methods in the Turtle library that I mentioned above.</p>
                <p>Next, we're going to give our Turtle a nickname. Why? Without a nickname, anytime we want to call a method, we'll need to have the following before the method call:</p>
                <table class="codetable">
                    <th>turtle.Turtle()</th>
                </table>
                <p>With a nickname, we will shorten this code and make it easier to read and write.</p>
                <p>To do this, include the following code:</p>
                <table class="codetable">
                    <th>name = turtle.Turtle()</th>
                </table>
                <p>Replace "name" with the name of your turtle! For example:</p>
                <table class="codetable">
                    <th>john = turtle.Turtle()</th>
                </table>
                <p>NOTE: The name of your turtle is case-sensitive, meaning that if the name has a variety of casing (upper/lower case letters), 
                    then having a different variety will cause your code to throw an error (e.g. John vs. john).</p>
                <p>Next, we're going to make sure we can test our code.</p>
                <p>Include the following code at the end of your program:</p>
                <table class="codetable">
                    <th>turtle.done()</th>
                </table>
                <p>This will line will ensure you can see your creation after the code is done running. Make sure all of the code you write fore 
                    your turtle is above this line. This line should always be the last line of your program.</p>
                <p>Next, we're going to set up the turlte. We're going to give it an outline color and a pen thickness.</p>
                <p>Include the following code:</p>
                <table class="codetable">
                    <tr>
                        <th>name.pencolor("black")</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>name.pensize(3)</th>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>Replace name with the name of your turtle. You can change the color of the outline to whatever color you want. Remember to 
                    use the format described in the methods dictionary above. You can change the thickness of the pen to whatever value you want, 
                    but I recommend keeping it a relatively thin number just so it's easier to see and use.</p>
                <p>Next, we're going to draw the shell of the turtle. Start by selecting what color you want the shell to be.</p>
                <p>Include the following code:</p>
                <table class="codetable">
                    <th>name.fillcolor("#ff00aa")</th>
                </table>
                <p>Replace name with the name of your turtle and replace #ff00aa with whatever color you'd like. By the way, the fillcolor() 
                    method will only work if we're creating a shape. I'll show you how to do this.</p>
                <p>Include the following code:</p>
                <table class="codetable">
                    <th>name.begin_fill()</th>
                </table>
                <p>Replace name with the name of your turtle. The begin_fill() method lets us start creating a shape. From here, experiment 
                    using the forward(), back(), left(), and right() methods to create the shape of the shell. Oce your shell is done, include the following code:</p>
                <table class="codetable">
                    <th>name.end_fill()</th>
                </table>
                <p>Replace name with the name of your turtle. The end_fill() method will tell the turtle to close the shape and fill it with the color we selected 
                    above. To ensure this happens, you can start by moving your turtle to a specific coordinate using the setx() and setu() methods and then moving 
                    your turtle back to those coordinates at the end of your shape drawing. You can use penup() and pendown() to move your turtle without creating 
                    any additional lines, if you choose to.</p>
                <p>Use these tools to then create the head and legs. You can customize the color of these parts, since they are their own shapes. You can create 
                    an eye for your turtle using the dot() method. You can run your code as many times as you want to experiment with values. Make sure you save 
                    the file first so that your changes will affect the test run.</p>
